Instructions:
  There are four zip files containing Naive Bayes library version, Naive Bayes scratch version, 
  KNN library version, and KNN scratch version respectively. All versions are written in Python
  and you need to extract the files in the zip file and place them in the directory where Document
  and Sample folders are. If you run the program, you will have to choose a method to represent 
  dataset (bag of words or TF-IDF), the value of T for T-most appearing words (if you choose to
  use T), the number of loops for subset part (for Naive Bayes only), and K-value (for KNN only).
  After that, the program will do the rest, outputing confusion matrix and performance factors 
  (Accuracy, Precision, and Recall).
